Even though we changed just one letter, the HMAC is completely different.

HMAC combines a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256) with a secret key.
It's used to ensure both data integrity and authenticity.
If any bit of the file changes (or if the key is wrong), the HMAC will not match â€” making it easy to detect tampering.
