1) echo "This file contains top secret information. AES encryption is used." > secret.txt
2) openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in secret.txt -out secret.enc

I enetered passprase at this point, and reentered because verification was needed
3) Decrypting
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in secret.enc -out secret_decrypted.txt

4) Checking files with command 
diff secret.txt secret_decrypted.txt


Gave me empty result, so no differences
